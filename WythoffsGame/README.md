What is Wythoff's Game ?
========================

Wythoff’s Game, named after Willem Abraham Wythoff, is a well known game amongst
number theorists. Dr. Wythoff, who received a Ph. D. in mathematics from the University of
Amsterdam in 1898, described this game in these words: “The game is played by two persons.
Two piles of counters are placed on a table, the number of each pile being arbitrary. The players
play alternately and either take from one of the piles an arbitrary number of counters or from
both piles an equal number. The player who takes up the last counter or counters, wins.” This
game was previously known in China as tsyan-shidzi (“choosing stones”), but was reinvented by
Wythoff. Wythoff published a full analysis of this game in 1907.

Nearly a half a century later, around 1960, Rufus P. Isaacs, a mathematician from Johns
Hopkins University, created another description of this same game. Completely unaware of
Wythoff’s game, Isaacs described the same game in terms of the moves of a chess queen allowed
only to travel south, west or southwest on a chessboard. This game was often called “Queen’s
Move” or “Cornering the Queen”. In this game the Queen is initially placed in the far right
column or in the top row of the chessboard. The player who gets the queen to the lower left
corner is the winner.

To begin researching this game and its strategies, it only makes sense to play the game in
small cases and look for patterns. To gain an understanding of the game I played the game of
puppies and kittens with my six year old son. Given the rules, the game had to begin with some
number of puppies and a different number of kittens. Mathematically speaking, if one starts with
p (puppies) = 0, k (kittens) = 0, or p = k, then by rules of the game player 1 wins. Thus, I started
with one puppy (p=1) and two kittens (k=2). In this case, no matter what, player 2 wins. If
player 1 takes the puppy, player 2 will win by taking all the kittens. Just the same, if player 1
takes all the kittens, player 2 will win by taking the puppy. If player 1 takes one puppy and one
kitten, player 2 wins by taking the remaining kitten. Likewise, if player 1 takes one kitten,
player 2 will win by taking the remaining puppy and kitten. This same reasoning applies if you
start with two puppies and one kitten; player two will win every time.
So what happens if p=3 and k=1? Strategically, player 1 is only one move away from
p=2, k=1, which I just examined. Player 1 has the winning edge. Player 1 just needs to take one
puppy, which forces player two to be the first player to play the p=2, k=1, which is a fatal
situation to be in. With this strategy, player 1 can win for k=1 and any number of puppies
greater than two. Similarly, player 1 can win for p=1 and any number of kittens greater than
two.

This strategy also holds true when taking an equal number of puppies and kittens in a
turn. If k=3, p=2 (or vise versa), player 1 would take one from each side forcing player two to be
the first player to play k=2, p=1. Similarly, if k=4, p=3, player 1 would take two from each side,
again forcing player two to be the first player to play k=2, p=1. In general, player 1 can win if
you start k=1, p=k+1 (or p=1, k=p+1) when k is greater than or equal to two.
