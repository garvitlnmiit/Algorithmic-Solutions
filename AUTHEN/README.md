Subsequences of Length N
========================

Given a string of length N+K(1 ≤ N ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 100), the task is to remove possible combinations of K characters
from the string and that combination need not be contiguous. The output will be total number of unique strings of length N that remains after the removal of combination of K character - 1.

+ The first line will take one integer T(Test Cases). Each test case is described by a line containing two integers 
N and K (1 ≤ N ≤ 10000, 1 ≤ K ≤ 100) separated by a single space, followed by a line containing a string of length 
N+K consisting of small Latin letters a..z.

+ For each test case output just one line containing the required number modulo 1009419529.
